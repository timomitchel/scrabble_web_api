## Project Setup

* Project was created using Ruby 2.4.1
* `rake db:setup`
* Confirm the data from `seeds.rb` is present in the database
* There's one model test that is left failing intentionally
* Get this test to pass
* Confirm you can start your Rails server and navigate to the app in your browser
* Install your preferred JSON library (i.e. [ActiveModel::Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers), [Jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder), [Fast JSON API](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi))
* Install an HTTP library (i.e. [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday), [HTTPart](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty))
* Decide how you want to mock HTTP calls (i.e. [Webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock), [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr))
* Decide how you want to handle and hide ENV variables
